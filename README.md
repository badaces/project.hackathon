# Greenhouse Gas Emissions' Effect On The Atmosphere: An Infographic For The Koding Global Virtual Hackathon

Our project addresses the Projects facing our planet theme. More specifically, want to create a quick look at the effects of greenhouse gas on the atmosphere. We present a card view on various elements of greenhouse emissions. We illustrate the negative impact of greenhouse gases on the global temperature and how the system perpetuates itself.

While there are an ever increasing number of resources explaining climate change, we chose to address the issue for our topic. Educational information about the atmospheric impact on climate change can be too complicated or even intimidating. In order to present a simple view, we chose to highlight only key data in our interface. In addition to highlighting the need to know details on greenhouse gas emissions, we seek to solidify our own understanding on the issue.
